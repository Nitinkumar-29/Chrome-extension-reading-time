To build a Chrome extension, first you need to create a `manifest.json` file in your extension project's `/root` folder.

Then include `"manifest_json":3`, `"version": "extension version"`, and `"name": "extension name"`

These are the main lines for any extension.

Please go ahead with well-organized documentation. 
Now that you have created a `manifest.json` file, 
Create your `content.js` which will be responsible for the action of an extension. 
Create a folder `/images` that will include all icons.

After you have written enough extension code, 
visit Chrome extension `developer mode` and click on the `load unpacked` button. 
Don't forget to check your `manifest.json` case sensitivity and enable hidden files show in your extension folder.
